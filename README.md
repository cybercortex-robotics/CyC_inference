## 1. Introduction

CyberCortex.AI Inference is a real-time AI execution system designed for autonomous robots and complex automation systems. It operates directly on embedded hardware, enabling robots to process sensory data, perform decision-making, and execute actions efficiently.

At its core, CyberCortex.AI Inference structures computations into modular units called "Filters", which function like lightweight AI-driven building blocks. These Filters are organized within a DataBlock, allowing seamless communication between different components of a robotic system. This architecture supports local and distributed execution, meaning robots can process data independently or collaborate with cloud-based AI for enhanced decision-making.

### Key Features
- **Real-Time Processing**: Executes AI models and sensor fusion algorithms with minimal latency.
- **Modular Design**: Uses Filters to manage various tasks like perception, motion planning, and control.
- **Distributed Execution**: Can run locally on embedded devices or communicate with cloud-based AI (CyberCortex.AI Dojo).
- **Temporal Addressable Memory (TAM)**: Optimizes data flow between Filters, ensuring efficient handling of sensory inputs and outputs.

CyberCortex.AI Inference is built to power next-generation autonomous systems, providing the intelligence needed for robotic control, AI-driven automation, and real-time decision-making in dynamic environments. üöÄ
